# Professional_Statement_Coursera
I am a cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python and SQL, which I use to identify vulnerabilities, analyze data, and strengthen digital defenses. Guided by a firm ethical and moral compass, I approach cybersecurity with integrity and accountability, ensuring that every decision I make upholds the safety and trust of those I serve. My passion lies in protecting people and organizations as technology evolves—bridging technical skill with ethical responsibility to anticipate, prevent, and respond to modern cyber threats. Through this blend of analytical ability, technical fluency, and principled action, I aim to contribute to organizations that value security, transparency, and public trust.
